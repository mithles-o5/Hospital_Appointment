# Hospital Appointment and Information System

## Problem Statement
At present, there is no platform which can have all virtual functionalities such as video call diagnosis help, online emergency facility & online monitoring patients, One-to-one communication in between patient & doctor virtually, etc.
So, we have focused on creating an integrated platform that can assimilate the patients and doctors under a single roof which is under a the admin supervision. 
This is in accordance with a problem raised by the AYUSH ministry in SIH (Smart India Hackathon) 2020.

## Motivation
As demand of an automatic system in the healthcare sector are high, we need to develop a unique web app for online OPD Appointment , Registration and Hospital Information System. We have focused on creating an integrated platform that can assimilate patients and doctors under a single roof which is under admin supervision. This would bring transparency and decentralization in the hospital management which is really uncommon as of now.
